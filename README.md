# Computercraft-Songs
Song system for Minecraft Computercraft Speakers
___

This is a project to allow the creation of custom songs using the [Computercraft: Tweaked](https://computercraft.cc/) Minecraft mod.

The songs are stored on a central server and sent to client computers to play on remote speakers.

We've made a selection of sample songs, as well as client and server programs to use for remote speaker systems.


#### Our current wishlist for future project features:

* Wiki-like website for documentation

* Basic MIDI conversion for importing

* Automatic client script updates

* and more!



We are not sponsored by or affiliated with Mojang, Computercraft: Tweaked, or any of the other mentioned projects and resources.
